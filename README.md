# Credit Risk Scoring System

### Project Outline: Credit Risk Scoring System

#### 1. Project Definition

**Objective**: Develop a machine learning model to predict the probability of default (credit risk) of a loan applicant based on their profile and financial data.

#### 2. Data Collection

- **Datasets**:
  - Public datasets such as the **Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk dataset** (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data)
  - If accessible, anonymized datasets from financial institutions.
  
- **Features**:
  - Applicant's demographic information (age, gender, education, etc.).
  - Financial history (previous loans, repayment history, etc.).
  - Credit bureau data.
  - Behavioral data (transaction history, account usage, etc.).

#### 3. Data Preprocessing

- **Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- **Normalization/Standardization**: Scale numerical features.
- **Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., debt-to-income ratio, credit utilization rate).

#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize the distribution of features.
- Analyze correlations between features and the target variable (default/non-default).
- Identify patterns and insights that could influence feature selection and model design.

#### 5. Model Development

- **Model Selection**: Experiment with various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
- **Training**: Split the data into training and validation sets.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the best model parameters.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensure model robustness by applying k-fold cross-validation.

#### 6. Model Evaluation

- **Metrics**: Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as AUC-ROC, Precision-Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix.
- **Interpretability**: Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret model predictions and ensure fairness.

#### 7. Model Deployment

- **API Development**: Create an API for the model using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.
- **Integration**: Integrate the API with a front-end application or existing financial system.
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring to track model performance over time and detect any degradation.

#### 8. Documentation and Reporting

- **Documentation**: Thoroughly document the entire process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, model development, and evaluation.
- **Reporting**: Create visual reports and dashboards to present findings and model performance to stakeholders.

#### 9. Future Enhancements

- **Continuous Learning**: Implement a pipeline for continuous learning where the model gets updated as new data comes in.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Explore advanced techniques like ensemble learning, transfer learning, or incorporating alternative data sources (e.g., social media behavior).

### Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Download and inspect the dataset.
   - Perform initial data cleaning.

2. **Data Preprocessing and EDA**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data.
   - Perform EDA to understand data distribution and relationships.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Develop and train multiple models.
   - Tune hyperparameters and select the best model.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate models using multiple metrics.
   - Interpret the best model's predictions.

5. **Model Deployment**:
   - Develop an API and deploy the model.
   - Monitor the deployed model.

6. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Document the process and create a final report.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, SHAP, LIME, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **API Framework**: Flask or FastAPI
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/GCP/Azure for hosting

### Expected Outcomes

- A comprehensive, end-to-end machine learning project that demonstrates your ability to handle real-world fintech problems.
- A deployable credit risk scoring model.
- An insightful analysis that can be presented to potential employers or stakeholders.
